# Intro to Java

- Programming language that is used everywhere (invented in 1995). Perhaps the most popular one.
- Originally invented in 1995 by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. That company was acquired by Oracle a couple of years ago.
- The latest version of Java is 8. Although not a whole lot has changed since Java 6.
- Named after the Java coffee (hence the logo), which itself is named after the Java island in Indonesia.
- Java is so popular that it has even inspired a bunch of derivatives; languages that are based on it or that use the Java JVM: Groovy, Scala, Jython, etc.
- "Write once, run everywhere" philosophy -> JVM, bytecode vs. compile+link and run for every platform
	- Means that you need to install the JVM first. JVM = Java Virtual Machine. JDK = Java Development Kit
	- This is fundamentally different from e.g. C/C++/Go/...
	- There is a difference between the JVM spec and the implementation. Hotspot vs. OpenJDK.

- OO is first citizen. You cannot do functional/procedural programming (You can to some extend using a workaround, but that's generally a very bad practice).
